# Power BI semantic model and report

This folder holds the semantic model (the part that is fully specified, version-controlled, and testable) and documents the report (the part that, in the real product, is a .pbix built in Power BI Desktop on top of that model). See the root README's "Why there is no .pbix" note for why the report itself is documented rather than shipped as a binary.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `measures.dax` | The full DAX measure library, hand-written, organized by folder (Sales and Margin, Inventory Health, Time Intelligence, RLS). Paste-able straight into Power BI Desktop's modeling view. |
| `model.bim` | A TMSL (Tabular Model Scripting Language) definition of the semantic model: every table, column, relationship, the same measures as `measures.dax` (kept in sync by `scripts/build_model_bim.py`), and the two RLS roles. Openable in Tabular Editor, or usable as the source for a `Model.bim`-based Power BI Desktop project. |

Regenerate `model.bim`'s measures after editing `measures.dax`:

```bash
python scripts/build_model_bim.py
```

`tests/test_dax_measures.py` and `tests/test_model_bim.py` enforce that the two files never drift apart and that both are syntactically well-formed.

## Report pages (4, interconnected)

1. **Executive Overview** - KPI cards (Gross Revenue, Gross Margin %, Gross Revenue YoY %, Inventory Turns), a revenue-by-month line chart with a PY comparison line, and a small multiples bar chart of Gross Margin % by category. A card shows `[Current User Region]` so a Regional Manager can see at a glance which slice of the model they're viewing under RLS.
2. **Margin Deep Dive** - Gross Margin % and Effective Discount % by category/subcategory in a matrix, a scatter of product-level margin % vs. units sold (bubble = revenue) to spot high-volume/low-margin SKUs, and the `Revenue Below Margin Floor` KPI trended by month. **Drillthrough** from any product point/matrix cell to page 4 (Product Detail) passing `product_id` as the drillthrough filter.
3. **Channel Performance** - Gross Revenue, Gross Margin %, and YoY % by channel and region, plus a bookmark-driven toggle between "Retail Stores" and "Digital + Wholesale" channel groupings (two bookmarks swapping a channel-type slicer selection and a matching visual-level filter, wired to a bookmark navigator button group). This is the page where the Regional Manager RLS role is most visible: a scoped user only ever sees their region's row in every visual here.
4. **Product and Inventory Detail** (drillthrough target) - Sell-Through %, Inventory Turns, Stockout Rate %, and Weeks of Supply for the product selected via drillthrough (or filtered directly via the page's product slicer), with a small-multiples on-hand-units-over-time chart per channel and a "back" button to return to Margin Deep Dive.

## Row-level security

Two roles are defined in `model.bim`:

- **Regional Manager** - dynamic RLS. The `dim_channel` table permission filters rows to the region looked up for `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` in `dim_user_region_map`; a mapped region of "ALL" (the HQ case) removes the filter entirely. Because the filter lives on `dim_channel` and both fact tables relate to it, every visual sliced by channel/region is automatically scoped - no per-visual filtering required.
- **HQ Analyst** - no table permissions; unrestricted read.

To test as a specific regional manager in Power BI Desktop: **Modeling -> View As -> Roles -> Regional Manager -> Other user** and enter one of the sample emails from `dim_user_region_map` (e.g. `ben.osei@retailco.example` for Midwest-only; `dana.wu@retailco.example` for the unrestricted `ALL` case).

## Bookmarks

- `bm_channel_view_retail` / `bm_channel_view_digital` on Channel Performance (described above).
- `bm_margin_alert_on` / `bm_margin_alert_off` on Margin Deep Dive, toggling visibility of the `Revenue Below Margin Floor` KPI card and an accompanying warning-colored border, for a "call out the risk" view used in the monthly finance review.
