# retail-margin-cockpit

**A governed margin and inventory source of truth for small/mid retail and DTC teams - dbt star schema, DAX measure library, and RLS-scoped Power BI cockpit, built on data that used to live in five different spreadsheets.**

## The problem

At small-to-mid retail and DTC companies, "what's our margin?" is usually a multi-hour Friday-afternoon exercise: someone exports the POS system, someone else exports Shopify, inventory counts live in a separate ledger or a spreadsheet someone maintains by hand, and none of it joins cleanly because product IDs and channel names don't match across systems. Finance gets a different margin number than Ops. Nobody trusts the stockout report because it's stale by the time it's built. And a Regional Manager who should only see their own region's numbers instead gets a filtered copy of a spreadsheet, maintained by hand, that's one missed filter away from leaking company-wide numbers.

`retail-margin-cockpit` is a working prototype of the fix: a small, governed dbt project that turns raw POS/Shopify/inventory exports into a tested star schema, plus the DAX measure library and row-level-security design that make that schema usable in Power BI by the people who actually need it - without another hand-maintained spreadsheet.

## How it works

1. **`data_generator/`** - a seeded Python generator produces two years of realistic, internally-consistent retail history (five channels across three regions + online + wholesale, 32 SKUs across four categories, seasonality, promo windows, weekly inventory snapshots, occasional stockouts) as the four raw CSVs a real retailer's POS/Shopify/inventory exports would look like. Same seed, same bytes, every run - which is what makes the pipeline downstream reproducible and testable.
2. **`dbt/retail_margin_cockpit/`** - a dbt project that seeds those CSVs, builds thin staging views, and materializes a star schema (`fact_sales`, `fact_inventory`, `dim_product`, `dim_channel`, `dim_date`, `dim_user_region_map`) with `not_null` / `unique` / `relationships` / `accepted_values` tests on every key column and documented column-level descriptions (`dbt docs generate` works out of the box). Targets DuckDB by default (embedded, zero-setup, what CI runs) and Postgres for production (`dbt build --target postgres`) - same SQL, same tests, either target.
3. **`powerbi/`** - a hand-written DAX measure library (`measures.dax`: gross margin %, sell-through %, inventory turns, YoY/MoM revenue, effective discount %, stockout rate, and more) and a TMSL semantic model (`model.bim`) with two row-level-security roles - **Regional Manager** (dynamic RLS scoped to one region via `dim_user_region_map`) and **HQ Analyst** (unrestricted) - documented report pages, and the bookmark/drillthrough design. `model.bim`'s measures are generated from `measures.dax` by `scripts/build_model_bim.py` so the two never drift apart.
4. **`sql/postgres_rls_demo.sql`** - the same regional-manager access boundary enforced one layer down, as native Postgres row-level security, for the SQL clients and pipelines that don't go through Power BI at all.

## The insight (why this matters)

Building this out on the synthetic two-year dataset surfaces exactly the kind of thing this cockpit exists to catch: **Footwear quietly runs 7-8 margin points below every other category, in every single channel.**

| Category | Revenue | Gross Margin % |
|---|---:|---:|
| Apparel | $1.99M | 52.0% |
| Home | $712.6K | 48.5% |
| **Footwear** | **$601.9K** | **42.4%** |
| Accessories | $586.0K | 52.3% |

It's not one bad channel or a one-off clearance event - Footwear sits at ~42% margin in every store, online, and wholesale alike, versus a company-wide blended average of 49.9%. That's invisible in a channel-by-channel spreadsheet reconciliation, but obvious the moment category and channel are joined in one governed model. If Footwear's margin simply matched the blended average, gross margin dollars would be roughly **$45K higher (~1.2% of total revenue) with zero change in units sold** - a pricing/discounting conversation Finance can now start with a number everyone agrees on, instead of three different spreadsheets.

## Row-level security

Two roles, mirrored in both the Power BI semantic model and the Postgres production target:

- **Regional Manager** - dynamic RLS: `dim_channel` (and, transitively, both fact tables) is filtered to the region looked up for the signed-in user in `dim_user_region_map`. A mapped region of "ALL" (the HQ case) removes the filter. See `powerbi/README.md` for exact test-as-user steps in Power BI Desktop, and `sql/postgres_rls_demo.sql` for the same boundary as native Postgres RLS policies.
- **HQ Analyst** - unrestricted read, for finance/ops leadership who need the whole company at once.

## Why there's no .pbix

Power BI Desktop is Windows-only and can't run in CI, and a binary `.pbix` doesn't diff or review meaningfully in git. Instead, the parts of the semantic model that are text - the DAX measures and the TMSL model definition - are checked in, tested (`tests/test_dax_measures.py`, `tests/test_model_bim.py`), and kept in sync by `scripts/build_model_bim.py`. `model.bim` opens directly in Tabular Editor, or as the source for a `Model.bim`-based Power BI Desktop project, so nothing here is hypothetical - it's the actual model, just stored as text instead of a binary.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Generate the synthetic two-year retail dataset (writes to dbt seeds/)
python -m data_generator.generate --out dbt/retail_margin_cockpit/seeds

# 2. Build the star schema + run all dbt tests, against embedded DuckDB
cd dbt/retail_margin_cockpit
dbt build --target duckdb
cd ../..

# 3. Run the full offline test suite (generator + dbt build/test + DAX/model checks)
python -m pytest -q
```

To point the same dbt project at a real Postgres warehouse instead:

```bash
export RMC_PG_HOST=... RMC_PG_USER=... RMC_PG_PASSWORD=... RMC_PG_DATABASE=...
dbt build --target postgres --project-dir dbt/retail_margin_cockpit --profiles-dir dbt/retail_margin_cockpit
psql "$RMC_PG_DSN" -f sql/postgres_rls_demo.sql
```

## Repository layout

```
data_generator/    Seeded synthetic retail dataset generator (Python)
dbt/                dbt project: seeds, staging views, star-schema marts, tests, docs
powerbi/            DAX measure library (measures.dax), TMSL model (model.bim), report/RLS docs
scripts/            build_model_bim.py -- keeps model.bim's measures in sync with measures.dax
sql/                Postgres row-level-security demo (production-target companion to Power BI RLS)
tests/              pytest suite: generator, dbt build+test, DAX/model consistency, RLS (opt-in)
```

## Testing

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

This is the full offline gate and is exactly what CI runs: the generator determinism tests, a real `dbt build --target duckdb` (seed load, staging views, all 6 star-schema mart tables, and the project's 56+ generic dbt tests), direct SQL sanity checks against the resulting DuckDB file, and consistency checks between `measures.dax` and `model.bim`. No network, no Docker, no real Postgres. The one exception is `tests/test_postgres_rls.py`, an opt-in integration test against a real Postgres instance - it's skipped automatically unless `RMC_TEST_PG_DSN` is set.

## Tech stack

Python (synthetic data generation) * dbt (transformation + testing) * DuckDB (embedded CI/dev target) * Postgres (documented production target) * DAX / Power Query / TMSL (Power BI semantic model, documented as text artifacts) * pytest.
